# EEG_Project

This project focuses on the amplification, filtering, collection, analysis and application of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. 
The project is organized into multiple submodules, each addressing different aspects of the EEG system, from data acquisition to signal processing and presentation.

# Folder Structure
The project is organized into the following directories:

- data/: Contains the raw and processed EEG data csv files.
- eeg_ide_ble/: Includes the arduino ide code for interfacing with the EEG hardware via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) of ESP32.
- eeg_python/: Contains Python scripts and libraries for analyzing and processing EEG data.
- matlab_eeglab/: Contains MATLAB script for converting csv files into set files for using the EEGLAB toolbox for advanced EEG data analysis.
- scheme_pcb/: Includes schematics and designs for the EEG hardware and associated PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards).
- presentation_eeg: Contains presentation files for explaining the project, such as PowerPoint slides.
